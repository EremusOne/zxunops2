== Introduction

zxunops2 is a converter from ZX Spectrum membrane keyboard to PS/2, used to control a ZX-Uno.

- Quest Original code base
- Neuro (@neurorulez) https://github.com/neurorulez/zx1ps2[First version] and keyboard shortcuts
- @spark2k06 improvements, optimizations and new keyboard shortcuts
- Thanks to @desUBIkado for being a tester and give new ideas for the alternate version

The connection is through an Arduino board, which converts the key presses to PS/2 protocol, using https://github.com/spark2k06/zxunops2[zxunops2 firmware]. The board is programmed in such a way that it can behave differently (keyboard mode), according to your needs.
